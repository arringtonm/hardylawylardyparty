# Tribute Page Project

## About

This website is a project designed to demonstrate a knowledge of Sass and its various techniques and its best practices while paying "tribute" to a favorite person or group.

## Requirements

* Stylesheets are organized using partials and easy to understand
* Nesting is no more than four levels deep
* Variables are used effectively
* At least one use of a Sass color function
* At least one Bourbon `@mixin`, function, or add-on
* At least one `@mixin` of your own
* Page is responsive (at least one breakpoint) using Sass-style media queries and/or the Neat grid
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, you can discuss your project with an instructor using the correct terminology

## Specs

The webpage is fully responsive and utilizes multiple breakpoints through various elements working in tandem (with both Neat's grid media queries and custom ones) to present the best layout for each possible size. At 1000px or greater, the site is in its full layout, with different elements shrinking, disappearing, or otherwise behaving differently at smaller sizes. Our "feature image," for instance, is prominently positioned at full resolution, but hides between 481-999px. 

## Technology used

This website is built with Sass, Bourbon, and Neat.
