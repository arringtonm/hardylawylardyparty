# Tribute Page Project

## About

This website is a project designed to demonstrate a knowledge of Sass and its various techniques and its best practices while paying "tribute" to a favorite person or group.

## Requirements

* Stylesheets are organized using partials and easy to understand
* Nesting is no more than four levels deep
* Variables are used effectively
* At least one use of a Sass color function
* At least one Bourbon `@mixin`, function, or add-on
* At least one `@mixin` of your own
* Page is responsive (at least one breakpoint) using Sass-style media queries and/or the Neat grid
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, you can discuss your project with an instructor using the correct terminology

## Technology used

This website is built with Sass, Bourbon, and Neat.

## Known Bugs

Not a "bug," per se, but the website is currently not responsive by design.
